<h1><b>Learning React Native 😃</b></h1>



<h3 id="description"><b>Description:</b></h3>

<h4> This is a simple project just for practicing react native and new concepts, the backend folder is in the same repository</h4>

<p>
   Its an Employee App, where you can add/edit/fire employees, and also visit their profiles to see details like job, salary...<br/>
   I've always been interested in mobile development, so after I finished a solid web application <a href="https://awgram.netlify.app">Awgram</a> (a MERN stack app),
   I started to learn React Native by building a simple project with React Native Expo,I've tested the app on my device. 
   I learned and coded along with a tutorial online and I really enjoyed it!!!!! this is the best method for me to practice new things/technologies.
   It was fun and I will continue learning and building amazing larger apps for mobile, and also to publish the top ones to the stores 😃🙏
